# Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis about US flights delays. In this project, I will be using R and Python to analyze the data.

# Dataset information
The dataset information was obtained from [Hardvard Dataset](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7). It composed of 4 different csv files: flights (2003 to 2007), airports, carriers and plane-data. The datasets provide information on flight details such as flight numbers, origin and destination airports, scheduled departure and arrival times, actual departure and arrival times, delays and reasons for cancellation.

# Questions the Data will answer
(a) What are the best times and days of the week to minimise delays each year?

(b) Evaluate whether older planes suffer more delays on a year-to-year basis.

(c) For each year, fit a logistic regression model for the probability of diverted US flights.
