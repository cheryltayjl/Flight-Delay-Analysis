This indicates that flights during this period experience significantly longer delays than other times of the day. Following this peak, there is a sharp drop in average delay during the 0600 to 0859, where delays reach their lowest point from 2003 to 2007 as indicated by the table above, which shows the lowest average flight delay for each year. However, the average flight delay during this interval has increased from 35.2 minutes to 37.3 minutes over the years.

This suggests that flights operated by this airline were significantly less likely to be diverted during those periods. On the other hand, carrier XE show more positive coefficients in 2006, highlighted in green. This indicates that flights operated by this carrier were more likely to be diverted during that year. Other features such as distance and time generally have more consistent positive or negative effects across years."
